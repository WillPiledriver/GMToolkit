This software is for calculating combat damage and storing player/non-player character data locally. It is designed to be used with any tabletop RPG with some assembly required. Originally made for damage calculation for Fallout pnp.

This software uses MongoDB to store game / player data and CSV files to store weapons, npcs, ammo, and armor.
